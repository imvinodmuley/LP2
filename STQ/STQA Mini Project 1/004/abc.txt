Q3 A:
Horizontal Decomposition
1. Functional or horizontal decomposition is the classical top-down methodology used in the design of many autonomous robot systems.
2. Hu and Brady describe the modules that make up the classic horizontal decomposition of a control system as follows:
 Perception: A module to gather information from the environment.
 Model: A module to build an environmental model from the robot’s perception of its environment.
 Plan: A module to construct a plan of action for the robot.
 Execute: A module that moves the robot based on the plan.
 Motion controller: A module to provide low-level control of the robot.
3. Within a horizontal control system the individual modules operate in a deterministic fashion.
4. Traditional deliberative architecture is based on sensing followed by planning. This is also known as the sense-plan-act cycle.
5. Systems that develop internal models upon which to conduct this planner are known as sense-model-plan-act or SMPA systems.

1. Whereas the horizontal or functional decomposition of the control task is based upon planning, reactive control [31], situated agents [9], embedded systems [312], motor schema [29], subsumption [99], or reflexive behavior [490] directly couple sensors and
actuators.
2. The reactive control paradigm is based on animal models of intelligence – the overall action of the robot is decomposed by behavior rather than by a deliberative reasoning process.
3. Behavior-based mechanisms were introduced to deal with a number of difficulties encountered in adapting classic planners to deal with low-level robot control. In particular, classic planners encounter difficulties with :
 Multiple goals. Unlike classic planners, which typically attempt to satisfy some single overall goal, low-level robot control must meet several goals simultaneously
 Multiple sensors. The sensors on a robot have real-time constraints. Data must be retrieved rapidly or they may be overwritten by subsequent measurements.
 Robustness. The low-level system must be relatively insensitive to conflicting, confounding, or missing data from one or more of the robots sensors.
 Extensibility. The control system should be easily modified to deal with changes in sensor, task, or locomotive configurations.
